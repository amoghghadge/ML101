### Gradient Descent

- An algorithm to minimize a function

- During the training process, we minimize the error function

- The error function takes in the model's prediction on the current data points as well as the correct answer on the data points that we want the model to learn to predict

- You take the derivative at your current guess for the minimum and multiply it by a small number (to have a small effect / small change step), then subtract the guess by this value to get closer to the true minimum
