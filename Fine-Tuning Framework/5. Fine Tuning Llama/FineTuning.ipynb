    "This is still pretty good considering, as before we did any fine-tuning at all (when we just had the pretrained model) it wasn't even able to talk back and forth with us / answer these questions at all. It could only keep predicting the next token in the sequence like an autocomplete. This is much better, with only 10 mins of fine-tuning on a dataset of 1000 examples, the model has become pretty good at understanding these instructions, comprehending the table schema, and generating an almost correct SQL query as a response. If we had a larger dataset and train for a longer amount of time, we could increase the performance of this model even further."
